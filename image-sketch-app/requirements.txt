Image to Pencil Sketch


Assignment
Select an image in RGB format and use the OpenCV Python library to transform it so that it resembles a pencil sketch.

Tips

Convert the RGB image to grayscale - this will turn the image into a classic black-and-white photo;
Invert the grayscale image - this is sometimes referred to as a negative image and can be used to enhance details;
Mix the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image - this can be done by dividing the pixel values of the grayscale image by the pixel values of the inverted blurry image; the result should resemble a pencil sketch;
Experiment by applying other transformations offered by the OpenCV library to improve the effect;
Data Description
We are providing you with a sample image of a dog, however, you can choose any colored image you want to complete this project.

Practicalities
Make sure that the solution reflects your entire thought process - it is more important how the code is structured rather than the final files.
